                            <h2>Resident Evil</h2>
                        <p>Resident Evil, or Biohazard in Japan and parts of Southeast Asia, is a Japanese horror game series and media franchise created by Capcom. It consists of survival horror, third-person shooter and first-person shooter games, with players typically surviving in environments inhabited by zombies and other frightening creatures. The franchise has expanded into other media, including a live-action film series, animated films, television series, comic books, novels, audio dramas and merchandise. Resident Evil is the highest-grossing horror franchise.</p>

                        <p>The first Resident Evil was created by Shinji Mikami and Tokuro Fujiwara and released for the PlayStation in 1996. It is credited for defining the survival horror genre and returning zombies to popular culture. With Resident Evil 4 (2005), the franchise shifted to more dynamic shooting action, achieved acclaim and influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the "over-the-shoulder" third-person view.</p>

                            <h2>Faith: The Unholy Trinity</h2>
                            <p>Faith is a survival horror video game developed by Airdorf Games for Windows. The game consists of three chapters; the first two were self-published by Airdorf Games in October 2017 and February 2019 respectively, while the third was published by New Blood Interactive in October 2022 as part of Faith: The Unholy Trinity (stylized as FAIâ€ H: The Unholy Trinity), a compilation of all three chapters with additional features. The game uses retro graphics similar to the graphics of an Apple II or Atari 2600.</p>

                            <p>Players control a priest as he first attempts to complete a failed exorcism, then tries to prevent the summoning of a great demon. The player's main weapon is a crucifix, which damages and slows enemies when held aloft. It can also exorcise possessed objects, which typically reveal notes that expand upon the game's plot or provide hints related to puzzles.</p>

                            <h2>At Dead Of Night</h2>
                            <p>At Dead Of Night is part horror film, part horror game and part ghost hunt. It seamlessly blends live-action and computer rendered graphics to create a unique immersive horror experience like no other. You play Maya, a student trapped in a remote hotel run by a psychopath called Jimmy Hall.</p>
                            <p>Jimmy has tied up Maya's friends and locked them in their rooms, with evil intentions. Maya has managed to escape, but Jimmy is on the prowl looking for her. However, to get him to release her friends, Maya must uncover Jimmy's dark secrets. Using an ancient ghost voice receiver she finds, Maya must communicate with the ghosts of Jimmy's past, who manifest around the hotel and gradually reveal their stories. At the end, after finding all about Jimmy's past, it is revealed that his dead father and former abuser Hugo Hall is possessing Jimmy, and is fighting him for control of his own body.</p>
                            <p>The game was developed using HTML5 and Node.js, scouring the game files reveals the main graphics to run entirely off of a single 4.1GB video file entitled "Hotel.m4v". This cannot be played back by conventional video players preinstalled in Windows. The main game works by skipping around in time in this video file of prerendered animations of the player character moving around the hotel.</p>
