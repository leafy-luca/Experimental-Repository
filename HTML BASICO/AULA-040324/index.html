            <header><h3>What is Vocaloid?</h3></header>
            <p>Vocaloid (ボーカロイド, Bōkaroido) is a singing voice synthesizer software product.
            <br>Its signal processing part was developed through a joint research project between Yamaha 
            <br>Corporation and the Music Technology Group in Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. 
            <br>The software was ultimately developed into the commercial product "Vocaloid" that was released
            <br>in 2004.</p>
            
            <p>The software enables users to synthesize "singing" by typing in lyrics and melody and also "speech" 
            <br>by typing in the script of the required words. It uses synthesizing technology with specially recorded
            <br>vocals of voice actors or singers. To create a song, the user must input the melody and lyrics. A piano
            <br>roll type interface is used to input the melody and the lyrics can be entered on each note. The software
            <br>can change the stress of the pronunciations, add effects such as vibrato, or change the dynamics and
            <br>tone of the voice.</p>

            <header><h3>Who is Hatsune Miku?</h3></header>
            <p>Hatsune Miku (Japanese: 初音ミク), officially code-named CV01, is a Vocaloid software voicebank developed by
            <br>Crypton Future Media and its official anthropomorphic mascot character, a 16-year-old girl with long, turquoise
            <br>twintails. Miku's personification has been marketed as a virtual idol, and has performed at live virtual concerts
            <br>onstage as an animated projection (rear-cast projection on a specially coated glass screen).

            <p>Miku uses Yamaha Corporation's Vocaloid 2, Vocaloid 3, and Vocaloid 4 singing synthesizing technologies. She also
            <br>uses Crypton Future Media's Piapro Studio, a standalone singing synthesizer editor. She was the second Vocaloid sold
            <br>using the Vocaloid 2 engine and the first Japanese Vocaloid to use the Japanese version of the 2 engine. The voice is
            <br>modeled from Japanese voice actress Saki Fujita.</p>
                
            <p>The name of the character comes from merging the Japanese words for first (初, hatsu), sound (音, ne), and future 
            <br>(ミク, miku),[a] thus meaning "the first sound of the future", which, along with her code name, refers to her position
            <br>as the first of Crypton's "Character Vocal Series" (abbreviated "CV Series"), preceding Kagamine Rin/Len (code-named
            <br>CV02) and Megurine Luka (code-named CV03). The number 01 can also be seen on her left shoulder in official artwork.</p>
